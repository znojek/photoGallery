1. To run app we need to install react package. Everything is described here: https://pl.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
2. we also need to install chart.js package from https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/installation.html Everything is described there.
3. App is pretty simple, but the max i could do because of studies.
4. Planning to rewrite code to properly cooperate with non-local DataBase.
5. chart is hardcoded but planning to re-build it to cooperate with JSON.
